    <p><b>Calculus</b>, a branch of Mathematics, developed by <b>Newton and Leibniz</b>, deals with the study of the rate of change, calculas define formula like f(2)<sup>n</sup> CM is generally used in Methematical models to obtain optimal solutions. It helps us to understand the changes between the values which are related by a function. calculus Math mainly focused on some important topics such <b>as differentiation, integration, limits, functions</b>, and so on. Scientific calculation provide formulas like H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.</p>
